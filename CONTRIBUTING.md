# 📌 Project Structure

NyayaVanni follows a full-stack architecture:

- `backend/` → Python backend services and API logic
- `frontend/` → React + Vite frontend application
- `.env.example` → Environment variable reference
- `CONTRIBUTING.md` → Contribution guidelines

Before contributing, it is recommended to explore the repository structure and understand how the frontend and backend interact.
